- **Performance**: Leverage server-side rendering for faster load times and improved user experience.
- **Next.js Integration**: Specifically designed for seamless integration with Next.js 14 projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A [Supabase account](https://supabase.io/)
- An existing [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project setup

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ElectricCodeGuy/SupabaseAuthWithSSR.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd SupabaseAuthWithSSR
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Database Setup

Before launching your application, you must configure the database schema within Supabase.

1. **Create the Users Table**

   Navigate to your Supabase project's SQL editor and execute:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE public.users (
       id uuid not null,
       full_name VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'UserName_Default',
       email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
   );
   ```

2. **Enable Row Level Security (RLS)**

   Secure your data by enabling RLS and setting up a user-specific access policy:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   CREATE POLICY user_is_owner ON users FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
   ```

   Ensure that "New users can sign up" is enabled in your project's Auth settings. Find this option at `Settings > Auth` in your Supabase dashboard. For more details, visit [Supabase Auth Settings](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth).

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   CREATE POLICY insert_for_auth_users ON public.users FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
   CREATE POLICY user_is_owner ON public.users FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
   ```

3. **Sign Up for an Account**

   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/auth` in your web browser.
   - Use the sign-up form to create an account. Ensure you use a valid email address that you have access to, as you'll need to verify it in the next step.

4. **Verify Your Email**

   - After signing up, Supabase will send an email to the address you provided. Check your inbox for an email from Supabase or your application.
   - Open the email and click on the verification link to confirm your email address. This step is crucial for activating your account and ensuring that you can log in and access the application's features.

## Setting Up the Waitlist Database in Supabase OPTIONAL

### Step 1: Create the `waiting_list` Table

Execute this SQL query in your Supabase SQL editor to create the `waiting_list` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE waiting_list (
id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
fullname TEXT,
erhverv TEXT,
created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Step 2: Configure Row Level Security (RLS)

1. **Enable RLS for the `waiting_list` table**:

   - Go to the `Authentication` > `Policies` section of your Supabase project dashboard.
   - Select your `waiting_list` table and toggle on RLS.

2. **Create an RLS policy for inserts**:
   - Still under `Policies`, click "New Policy".
   - Set the **Policy Name** to `Allow user inserts`.
   - For **Policy Definition**, choose `INSERT` as the action.
   - Use `(auth.role() = 'authenticated')` for the **Using expression**.
   - Leave the **Check expression** blank or adjust it according to your requirements.
   - Finalize by setting the **Policy Command** to `INSERT`.

This setup allows authenticated users to insert new entries into the `waiting_list` table while preventing them from reading other entries.

## Setting Up the Error Feedback Database in Supabase OPTIONAL

### Step 1: Create the `error_feedback` Table

To store error feedback data, execute this SQL query in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
CREATE TABLE error_feedback (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    feedback TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT,
    errorMessage TEXT,
    errorStack TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

This table will store feedback messages, their categories, any associated error messages, and the error stack trace to help with debugging.

### Step 2: Configure Row Level Security (RLS)

1. **Enable RLS for the `error_feedback` table**:

   - Navigate to `Authentication` > `Policies` in your Supabase project dashboard.
   - Select the `error_feedback` table and enable RLS.

2. **Create an RLS policy for inserts (Optional)**:
   - If you want to restrict who can insert data into this table, you can create a policy.
   - Click "New Policy", provide a name like `Allow feedback insertion`.
   - Set the **Policy Definition** to allow `INSERT` operations.
   - For the **Using expression**, you could use `(auth.role() = 'authenticated')` to only allow authenticated users to insert feedback.
   - Leave the **Check expression** as is if no further restrictions are needed or adjust according to your requirements.
   - Ensure the **Policy Command** is set to `INSERT`.

### Environment Variables

Configure your environment by renaming `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and updating it with your Supabase project details:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon (public) key.

Optional variables for extended functionality:

- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID`
- `CLIENT_SECRET`

For third-party auth configurations, include:

- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
